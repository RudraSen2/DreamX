## Comments

### From Rudra

- The Main content is stored in `/docusaurus.config.js`. From there you can Edit the content.
- To learn Basics of docusaurus, there is a tutorial link and blog link on the top/sidebar. That may be useful for you.
- We'll publish it to Netlify and for that You have to create a Repository named `MultiSeven-Site` and a Netlify Account (netlify.com).
- If you want to use MUI then visit https://mui.com/joy-ui
